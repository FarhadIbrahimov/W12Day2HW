## Introduction

This project focuses on creating a Pokemon App that utilizes Express to serve server-side rendered views. Users can view a list of Pokemon names, click on individual Pokemon to view more details, and even create new Pokemon.

## Learning Objectives

- Practice setting up Express routes for index and show functionality.
- Gain experience in creating new and create routes with Express.
- Utilize JSX and server-side rendering for dynamic views.

## Prerequisites

To work on this project, you should have a basic understanding of:

- JavaScript
- Express
- Node
- JSX

## User Stories

1. As a user, I want to see a list of Pokemon names on the index page.
2. When I click on a Pokemon's name, I want to be taken to its show page where I can view its details.
3. I also want the ability to create new Pokemon and be redirected back to the index page.
